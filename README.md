# Low-overlap-registration-dataset
This is a repository to present our 3D low-overlap registration dataset with semantic assistance (abbreviate 3DSeReg-LoVer).
Our work mainly includes three sections: indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, and single models. Each part is illustrated as follows.
1. Indoor dataset
We choose the 3DMatch dataset as a basis to construct our semantic registration indoor dataset. 3DMatch is the widely-used dataset and is well known to researchers. It has various scenarios. In particular, some of its scenarios are distributed with repetitive geometric structures and occlusion that are challenges needed to be addressed. One annotation processing example of this part is shown in the figure below.

2. Outdoor dataset
This part is constructed based on the KITTI and SemanticKITTI datasets. The main processing is shown as follows.

3. Single objects from projects
These single objects come from real industrial components and are collected with our 3D structure light scanners.
