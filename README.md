# Low-overlap-registration-dataset
This is a repository to present our 3D low-overlap registration dataset with semantic assistance (abbreviate 3DSeReg-LoVer).
Our work mainly includes three sections: indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, and single models. Each part is illustrated as follows.
1. Indoor dataset
We choose the \textit{3DMatch} dataset as a basis to construct our semantic registration indoor dataset. \textit{3DMatch} is the widely-used dataset, which is well known.
